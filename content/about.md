I am a Data Science student at the University of Arkansas. My ideal concentration
accoutning analytics becuase my goal is to be a forensic accountant for the CIA.
I am also majoring in Acounting at the Walton School of business.

The purpose of this blog is to demonstrate my skills in R programming. Over the 
semester I have learned many new programming skills. This blog demonstrates my 
skills in data reading, manipulation, cleaning, and visualization. While this 
blog utilizes R, I also know Java and python. This project also utilizes github.
