<p>Using the sf_trees.csv dataset from Tidy Tuesday, I investigate what the trees
are like in San Francisco. The data has 192,987 observations and 12 variables.
The variables are the ID given to the tree, the legal status of the tree, the
species of the tree, the street address, the order of the trees in the case that
there are multiple trees at one location, where the tree is on the lot, the
primary caretaker of the tree, the date it was planted, the diameter of the tree,
the dimension of the plot, the latitude the plant is at, and the longitude the
tree is planted.</p>

<p>This reveals that there is a lot about where the trees are in San Francisco. A
person can easily see the street layout of San Francisco. Also, a person can see
how well the streets are lined with trees. It also shows where the data set
didn’t collect data, which is parks. The long strip in the left side of the map
is actually Golden Gate Park which has several trees, but these trees were not
included in the scope of the research. The central blank area as well as the
North West and South West are areas reserved for more nature, usually golf
courses. the only area with no trees that actually has no trees is the area in
the South East. This is a primarily commercial area with few street decorations
or Trees. The blue indicates private trees, which suggests that while the trees
may be mandatory to be on a street, it is still the land owner’s responsibility
to take care of the tree.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, there is a lot of variety in tree. About 50% of trees have less
than 5000 of the same type of tree. Considering there are around 200,000 trees,
it means that only 11 tree types are over 2.5% of the trees in the San Francisco
area. This indicates that the people care about their yards and their plants and
want their yards to be more unique and have personality, so they choose a more
unique tree. The area also must be habitable for any different tree types because
there is so much of a variety. If there was a large potion of any one type of
tree, it would be assumed that there is a smaller tree pool to choose from for
consumers. However, it looks like people have found that many trees can grow
well in the San Francisco area.</p>

<p>As seen in the graph, a majority of the trees are on sidewalk curbs. This is
most likely why we see such a distinct street layout in the spatial map. These
trees most likely consists of the more common tree types because they are on
streets. Since they are on streets, it suggests that there is some degree of
uniformity set in place by some form of city official or home owners association.
Of the relatively smaller tree locations, they are mostly in yards. This I believe
is where the variation in tree types comes from. In yards, it is more likely that
people can take more creative freedom on what kind of tree they want. While some
trees look nice on a curb, other more exciting and unique trees are in private
yards to add more character to one’s home.</p>

<p>These graphs shows that trees that grow in yards grow bigger for their age then
other trees. While other spots may use trees as decoration, trees should be in
the place where they grow the best.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>San Francisco has many beautiful trees in its cities that like to line the roads
and street layout. It also has many trees that are in large parks as well as in
people’s personal yards. There is a lot of variation in the tree types, and no
one tree has near a large portion at all. This adds to the diversity of the city
However, if trees grew in yards, the trees would grow bigger and better.</p>
